# Stats-Inference-Practicum
Data analysis using statistical inference techniques to draw conclusions. 

## Overview

This repository contains the codes used for the completion of the Practicum in Probability and Statistics II in February 2021. The practicum involves the analysis of data using statistical inference techniques to draw conclusions using R.

## Study

The study consists of four parts, each involving specific tasks and analyses. The dataset is referred to as "Data," and different statistical methods and techniques are applied to it.

### Part 1: Model Identification and Sampling

- Identification of the distribution model.
- Descriptive analysis of variables.
- Fitting data to various distributions.
- Sampling and distribution analysis.

### Part 2: Classical Estimation (Point, Intervals)

- Point estimation methods.
- Confidence intervals for means, variances, proportions, etc.
- Estimation with known and unknown variances.
- Interval estimation for population parameters.

### Part 3: Bayesian Estimation (Point, Intervals)

- Bayesian estimation concepts.
- Point and interval estimation using Bayesian methods.
- Estimation of proportions.

### Part 4: Parametric and Non-parametric Tests

- Parametric tests for population parameters.
- Non-parametric tests for distribution, independence, and homogeneity.
